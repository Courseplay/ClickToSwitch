# A Mod for Farming Simulator 19 to Switch Vehicles by Mouse Click
This was developed as a way to quickly jump from your current vehicle to another vehicle 
by mouse clicking on the vehicle on-screen.

This can provide a quicker way of getting into a vehicle which you can see from your 
current position rather that cycling through your vehicles with a hotkey.

## How to Use
While in a vehicle, turn to face another vehicle that you have permission to enter then
click on the other vehicle. You should switch to that vehicle.

## Notes
1) The vehicle must be visible and within range (1000 meters, which is pretty well a pixel on the horizon) 
   to be able to switch to it.
2) You must click on the power unit. For a tractor with a trailer, you must click on the tractor.
   Clicking on the trailer won't do anything.
